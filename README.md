Automation is key – It removes manual work by automating code deployment, testing, and infrastructure setup.

CI/CD Pipeline – Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) ensure that code updates are tested and released smoothly.

Monitoring & Feedback – DevOps constantly monitors applications and systems to catch problems early and improve performance.
